# Knapsack DP formulation example

This is inspired from the __Discrete optimization__ course of Coursera, and the DP formulation technique is from **REF to add**.

To launch this example, you need to have the package `CPRL` added to your environment.

Being inside that folder in the terminal (`examples/knapsack/`), you can launch:

```julia
julia> include("knapsack.jl")
julia> solve_knapsack("data/ks_4_0")
```

This will print the solutions found.
