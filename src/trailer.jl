"""
    Trailer

The trailer is the structure which makes it possible to memorize the previous State of our model 
during the search. It makes it possible to handle the backtrack.

    StateObject{T}(value::T, trailer::Trailer)

A reversible object of value `value` that has a type `T`, storing its modification into `trailer`.

"""
    StateEntry{T}(value::T, object::StateObject{T})

An entry that can be stacked in the trailer, containing the former `value of the object, and a reference to
the `object` so that it can be restored by the trailer.

Store the current value of `var` into its trailer.

function trail!(var::StateObject)
    push!(var.trailer.current, StateEntry(var.value, var))
end

"""
    setValue!(var::StateObject{T}, value::T) where {T}

Change the value of `var`, replacing it with `value`, and if needed, store the
former value into `var`'s trailer.
"""

Store the current state into the trailer, replacing the current stack with an empty one.

    restoreState!(trailer::Trailer)

Iterate over the last state to restore every former value, used to backtrack every change 
made after the last call to [`saveState!`](@ref).

    for se in trailer.current

"""
    withNewState!(func, trailer::Trailer)

Call the `func` function with a new state, restoring it after. Aimed to be used with the `do` block syntax.

# Examples
```julia
using SeaPearl
trailer = SeaPearl.Trailer()
reversibleInt = SeaPearl.StateObject{Int}(3, trailer)
SeaPearl.withNewState!(trailer) do
    SeaPearl.setValue!(reversibleInt, 5)

"""
function withNewState!(func, trailer::Trailer)
    saveState!(trailer)
    func()
    restoreState!(trailer)

"""
    restoreInitialState!(trailer::Trailer)

Restore every linked object to its initial state. Basically call [`restoreState!`](@ref) until not possible.
"""
function restoreInitialState!(trailer::Trailer)
    while !isempty(trailer.prior)
        restoreState!(trailer)
